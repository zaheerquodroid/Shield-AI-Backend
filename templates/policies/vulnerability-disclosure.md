### 3.2 Report Contents

Please include the following in your report:

- Description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Affected systems, URLs, or components
- Proof of concept (screenshots, HTTP requests, scripts)

## 4. What to Expect

### 4.1 Response Timeline

| Action | Timeline |
|--------|----------|
| Acknowledgment of report | Within 2 business days |
| Initial assessment and triage | Within 5 business days |
| Status update on remediation | Within 15 business days |
| Resolution of Critical vulnerabilities | Within 30 days |
| Resolution of High vulnerabilities | Within 60 days |
| Resolution of Medium/Low vulnerabilities | Within 90 days |

### 4.2 Communication

- We will acknowledge your report and provide a tracking reference

## 5. Safe Harbor

### 5.1 Our Commitment

{{COMPANY_NAME}} will not pursue legal action against security researchers who:

- Act in good faith and in accordance with this policy
- Avoid actions that could harm {{COMPANY_NAME}}, its customers, or its users
- Do not access, modify, or delete data belonging to others
- Report vulnerabilities promptly and provide reasonable time for remediation
- Do not disclose vulnerability details publicly before resolution

### 5.2 Researcher Obligations

To qualify for safe harbor protection, researchers must:

- Comply with all applicable laws
- Only interact with accounts you own or have explicit permission to test
- Stop testing and report immediately upon discovering sensitive data
- Not exploit a vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it
- Not perform actions that could degrade or disrupt {{COMPANY_NAME}} services
- Not attempt to access or exfiltrate customer or user data
- Not conduct physical, social engineering, or denial of service attacks

## 6. Recognition

### 6.1 Acknowledgment

- Offer non-monetary recognition for significant findings

### 6.2 Coordinated Disclosure

We request a coordinated disclosure period of 90 days from the initial report to allow for remediation. We will work with you to agree on a disclosure timeline.

## 7. Qualifying Vulnerabilities

Examples of vulnerabilities we are interested in:

- Remote code execution
- SQL injection and other injection flaws
- Authentication or authorization bypasses
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) with demonstrated impact
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) on sensitive actions
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
- Information disclosure of sensitive data
- Insecure direct object references
- Privilege escalation
- Significant cryptographic weaknesses

## 8. Non-Qualifying Issues

The following are generally not eligible:

- Missing security headers without demonstrated exploit
- Clickjacking on pages with no sensitive actions
- Self-XSS (requires victim to paste code in their own browser)
- Rate limiting issues on non-authentication endpoints
- Content spoofing or text injection without security impact
- Disclosure of publicly available information
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without proof of concept

## 9. Legal

This policy is intended to be compatible with the Department of Justice's framework for vulnerability disclosure programs. Nothing in this policy should be interpreted as authorization to violate any law.

## 10. Review

This policy shall be reviewed at least annually. Next scheduled review: {{REVIEW_DATE}}.
