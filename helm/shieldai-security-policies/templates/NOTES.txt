ShieldAI Security Policies deployed to namespace: {{ include "shieldai.namespace" . }}

The following NetworkPolicy resources have been created:

{{- if .Values.policies.defaultDenyIngress }}
  - default-deny-ingress: Blocks ALL inbound traffic to pods
{{- end }}
{{- if .Values.policies.defaultDenyEgress }}
  - default-deny-egress: Blocks ALL outbound traffic from pods (baseline)
{{- end }}
{{- if .Values.policies.allowDnsEgress }}
  - allow-dns-egress: Permits DNS (UDP+TCP {{ .Values.dns.port }}) to {{ .Values.dns.namespace }}
{{- end }}
{{- if .Values.policies.allowHttpsEgress }}
  - allow-https-egress: Permits HTTPS (TCP {{ .Values.https.port }}) to external IPs only
    Blocked CIDRs: {{ join ", " .Values.blockedCIDRs.rfc1918 }}
{{- end }}
{{- if .Values.policies.allowCallbackEgress }}
  - allow-callback-egress: Permits callback to {{ .Values.callback.cidr }}:{{ .Values.callback.port }}
{{- end }}

IMPORTANT: These policies use a default-deny approach. Only explicitly
allowed traffic will be permitted. Verify your workloads can reach
required services after deployment.

SECURITY WARNINGS — INHERENT KUBERNETES LIMITATIONS:

  1. CNI ENFORCEMENT REQUIRED: NetworkPolicy enforcement requires a
     compatible CNI plugin (Calico, Cilium, Weave Net). Flannel alone
     does NOT enforce NetworkPolicy — policies are silently accepted
     but never applied. Verify with: deploy a deny-all policy and test
     cross-pod connectivity.

  2. hostNetwork BYPASS: Pods with hostNetwork: true completely bypass
     NetworkPolicy. Use PodSecurityStandards (Restricted profile) or
     admission controllers to prevent hostNetwork in tenant namespaces.

  3. hostPort BYPASS: Pods exposing hostPort may receive traffic via
     node DNAT that bypasses NetworkPolicy on some CNIs (AWS VPC CNI).
     Block hostPort via PodSecurityStandards.

  4. ADDITIVE SEMANTICS: NetworkPolicy is ADDITIVE (union). These
     policies CANNOT override explicit allow policies deployed by other
     controllers. An additional policy allowing 10.0.0.0/8 will
     override the except list in allow-https-egress. Audit all
     NetworkPolicy resources in the namespace.

  5. DNS TUNNELING: DNS egress is scoped to CoreDNS pods in
     {{ .Values.dns.namespace }}, but CoreDNS forwards queries to
     upstream DNS. L4 NetworkPolicy cannot inspect DNS query content.
     For L7 DNS inspection, use Cilium or Calico Enterprise DNS policies.

  6. API SERVER ACCESS: The Kubernetes API server may be reachable via
     its public endpoint (EKS/GKE) on port 443. Add the API server's
     public IP CIDR to blockedCIDRs.extra or restrict via RBAC.

  7. DUAL-STACK IPv6: On dual-stack clusters, add IPv6 equivalents to
     blockedCIDRs to prevent IPv4-mapped IPv6 bypass (::ffff:169.254.169.254).
     Current policies only cover IPv4 ipBlock rules.

  8. POD STARTUP RACE: Some CNIs (AWS VPC CNI standard mode, k3s)
     enforce policies asynchronously after pod start. Use strict
     enforcement mode where available (EKS: NETWORK_POLICY_ENFORCING_MODE=strict).

  9. CILIUM ipBlock BEHAVIOR: Cilium does NOT enforce ipBlock rules on
     pod IPs — use podSelector/namespaceSelector for pod-to-pod control.
     The default-deny + except list approach works for external traffic.

  10. NAMESPACE DELETION RACE (CVE-2024-7598): NetworkPolicies may be
      deleted before pods during namespace termination, creating a brief
      enforcement gap. Consider the network-policy-finalizer controller.

To verify policies:
  kubectl get networkpolicies -n {{ include "shieldai.namespace" . }}

To test enforcement:
  kubectl run test --rm -it --image=busybox -n {{ include "shieldai.namespace" . }} -- wget -qO- --timeout=3 http://169.254.169.254/
  (Should timeout if policies are enforced)
